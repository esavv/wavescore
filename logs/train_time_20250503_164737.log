# model: surf_maneuver_model_20250504_0101.pth
# Prod mode (RGB, skip 2) with hyperparameters (on 3D CNN), now with class weighting:
#    batch_size = 3 
#    learning_rate = 0.001
#    num_epochs = 5

# Notes:
# - finally got maneuvers predicted! but, it mostly predicted airs & floaters, 2 of the 
#   most infrequent classes, which suggests that we overdid it with the inverse weighting 
#   and the focal loss.
