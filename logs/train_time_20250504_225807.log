# model: surf_maneuver_model_20250505_0608.pth
# Prod mode (RGG, skip 2) with hyperparameters (on 3D CNN), now with class weighting:
#    batch_size = 3 
#    learning_rate = 0.001
#    num_epochs = 5
# This time though:
# - More complex architecture with dropout layers and learning rate scheduler
# - Lower gamma for focal loss to fix overcorrection in last run

# Notes:
# - Still predicting low freq maneuvers with converging confidence, not useful
# - Next time, let's use the balanced class weighting option (cube root)
