# See training_config_20250506_2042.json
# Notes:
# - First meaningful training of a frozen 3D cnn and we got some interesting results
# - Predicted no maneuver for all sequences, but confidence varied across sequences and in general
#      the model was less confident in sequences that actually had a maneuver
# - Some good next steps here:
#    - Update the inference code to print the correct maneuver prediction alongside
#      the actual prediction
#    - Train a new model with more aggressive weighting correction (go up 1 from balanced) and
#      more epochs & try again
