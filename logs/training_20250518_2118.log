Inference Notes
-------------
 - GPU utilization on g5.xlarge at 32 batch size: 17009MiB / 23028MiB; ~74%
    This seems like the right batch size for this hardware.
 - This is starting to look promising. On our inference video from the training set, the model
    correctly predicts 10 of the 15 sequences, and during the stretch from sequence 7-11 when
    3 actual cutbacks are performed, the model predicts 2 of them, but seems to be off by 1
    sequence in its predictions... so it correctly determines that during this stretch the surfer
    is either performing cutbacks or is not performing any maneuvers.
 - While there's more to do, this is good enough for now.
