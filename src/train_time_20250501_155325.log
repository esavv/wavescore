# Prod mode with these hyperparameters:
# batch_size = 3
# learning_rate = 0.002
# num_epochs = 5
# Notes:
# - Also relabeled the first heat with updated maneuver taxonomy
# - Also fixed the aspect ratio of the images
# - Also fixed the num_classes in the model to match the new taxonomy
# - Aaaand it's still not working, inference still predicts no maneuvers
