# Prod mode with these hyperparameters:
# batch_size = 2
# learning_rate = 0.005
# num_epochs = 1
# Notes:
# - Surprisingly, this model trained faster than dev mode hyperparameters with full color images and no frame skipping.
# - Inference still results in no maneuvers detected.

Consider using tensor.detach() first. (Triggered internally at /Users/runner/work/pytorch/pytorch/pytorch/aten/src/ATen/native/Scalar.cpp:23.)
